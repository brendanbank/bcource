# Changes Log

## [Unreleased] - 2025-10-23

### Added - SMS Two-Factor Authentication & Notifications

#### New Features
- **SMS Two-Factor Authentication via AWS SNS**: Users can now enable SMS as a two-factor authentication method
- **Custom Phone Number Validation**: International phone number validation and normalization using phonenumbers library
- **Separate 2FA Phone Field**: New `tf_phone_number` field in User model specifically for two-factor authentication
- **SMS Notifications for Waitlist**: Students receive SMS notifications when invited from waitlist (in addition to email)
- **AWS SNS Integration**: Complete integration with Amazon Simple Notification Service for SMS delivery
- **Rate Limiting & Quota Tracking**: Built-in rate limiting and delivery tracking for SMS messages
- **Multi-Method 2FA**: Support for email, authenticator app, and SMS (configurable)

#### Files Modified

##### `/bcource/sms_util.py` (New File)
- **AWS SNS SMS Sender**: Custom sender class implementing Flask-Security's SMS sender interface
- **Phone Number Validation**:
  - `validate_phone_number()` - Validates and formats phone numbers to E.164 format
  - Supports international numbers with country code detection
  - Returns formatted number and validation status
- **SMS Sending**:
  - `send_sms()` - Sends SMS via AWS SNS with error handling
  - Logs message IDs for tracking
  - Warns about potential delivery issues
  - Supports configurable sender ID
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against SMS abuse

##### `/bcource/__init__.py`
- **Custom Phone Utility**: Implemented `CustomPhoneUtil` class for Flask-Security
  - `validate_phone_number()` - Form validation integration
  - `get_canonical_phone()` - Phone number normalization before storage
- **SMS Sender Registration**: Registered AWS SNS sender with Flask-Security's `SmsSenderFactory`
- **Initialization**: Phone utility passed to `security.init_app()`

##### `/bcource/models.py`
- **Added field**: `tf_phone_number` (String(32), nullable) - Separate phone number for 2FA
- Allows users to use different phone number for authentication vs. contact

##### `/bcource/templates/security/two_factor_setup.html`
- **Radio Button Selection**: Users select preferred 2FA method (email, authenticator, SMS)
- **Dynamic Phone Input**: Phone number field appears when SMS method selected
- **Pre-populated Data**: Uses existing `tf_phone_number` if available
- **Improved UX**: Clear method selection with descriptions

##### `/bcource/students/common.py`
- **Waitlist SMS Notifications**: Added SMS notification when inviting users from waitlist
- **Dual Notification**: Sends both email and SMS (if phone number provided)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if SMS fails

##### `/config.py`
- **AWS SNS Configuration**:
  - `SECURITY_SMS_SERVICE` = 'aws_sns'
  - `AWS_REGION_NAME` - AWS region for SNS
  - `AWS_SNS_SENDER_ID` - Display name for SMS sender
- **2FA Methods**:
  - Initially enabled: `['email', 'authenticator', 'sms']`
  - Later disabled SMS: `['email', 'authenticator']` (commit 90fe932)
- **Rate Limiting**: SMS rate limit configuration

##### `/requirements.txt` & `/Pipfile`
- **Added dependencies**:
  - `boto3` - AWS SDK for Python
  - `botocore` - AWS core functionality
  - `jmespath` - JSON query language (boto3 dependency)
  - `s3transfer` - Amazon S3 transfer manager (boto3 dependency)
  - `qrcode` - QR code generation for authenticator apps
  - `phonenumbers` - Phone number parsing and validation

##### Test Files (New)
- `/test_sms.py` - SMS functionality testing
- `/check_sms_quota.py` - AWS SNS quota monitoring script

#### Technical Details

##### AWS SNS Integration
- Uses Amazon Simple Notification Service for reliable SMS delivery
- Configurable via environment variables (AWS credentials, region)
- Supports international phone numbers in E.164 format
- Logs message IDs for delivery tracking and debugging

##### Phone Number Handling
- **Validation**: Uses Google's libphonenumber for accurate validation
- **Normalization**: Converts all numbers to E.164 format (+CCNNNNNN)
- **Storage**: Separate field prevents contact phone number changes from affecting 2FA
- **Display**: Formats numbers in local or international format for display

##### Two-Factor Authentication Flow
1. User navigates to Two-Factor Setup
2. Selects preferred method via radio buttons
3. If SMS selected:
   - Enters phone number
   - Number validated and normalized
   - Stored in `tf_phone_number` field
4. Receives verification code via selected method
5. Enters code to enable 2FA

##### SMS Notification Flow
1. Waitlist invitation triggered
2. System checks for user's phone number
3. If phone exists:
   - Sends email notification
   - Sends SMS notification
   - Logs both delivery attempts
4. If phone missing:
   - Sends email only

##### Configuration Changes
**Initial Implementation** (Oct 11):
```python
SECURITY_TWO_FACTOR_ENABLED_METHODS = ['email', 'authenticator', 'sms']
```

**Later Disabled** (Oct 17):
```python
SECURITY_TWO_FACTOR_ENABLED_METHODS = ['email', 'authenticator']  # SMS removed
```

Reason: SMS method disabled but infrastructure remains for future re-enablement

#### Security Considerations

**Best Practices**:
1. Phone numbers validated before storage
2. Separate 2FA phone prevents accidental lockouts
3. Rate limiting prevents SMS abuse
4. AWS credentials stored in environment variables (not in code)
5. Message delivery tracked via AWS SNS logs

**Privacy**:
- Phone numbers encrypted at rest (database level)
- SMS content minimal (verification codes only)
- No phone numbers shared with third parties except AWS SNS

#### Known Limitations
- SMS method currently disabled in configuration (can be re-enabled)
- Requires AWS account and SNS configuration
- SMS delivery subject to AWS SNS availability
- International SMS may have additional costs

#### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
1. SMS delivery status webhooks
2. Fallback SMS provider
3. SMS templates for other notifications
4. Delivery rate analytics dashboard

### Added - User Impersonation Feature

#### New Features
- **Admin User Impersonation**: Administrators can now view the application from a student's perspective to provide better support and troubleshoot issues
- **Security-First Design**:
  - Only `db-admin` role users can impersonate
  - Two-factor authentication (2FA) required for all impersonation
  - Cannot impersonate other administrators (prevents privilege escalation)
  - Cannot impersonate yourself
  - Only active users can be impersonated
- **Visual Warning Banner**: Prominent red banner appears at the top of every page during impersonation showing:
  - "Impersonation Mode Active" warning
  - User being impersonated (name and email)
  - Original admin account information
  - Quick "Exit Impersonation" button
- **Confirmation Workflow**: Two-step process with detailed confirmation page showing user details before impersonation
- **Search & Filter Integration**: Enhanced User admin list with:
  - Search functionality (email, first name, last name, phone number)
  - Filter by active status and roles
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All impersonation sessions logged at WARNING level with:
  - Admin email and ID
  - Target user email and ID
  - Start and stop timestamps
  - Session duration tracking

#### Files Modified

##### `/bcource/helpers.py`
- **Added impersonation helper functions**:
  - `is_impersonating()` - Check if currently impersonating
  - `get_original_user()` - Get the admin user
  - `get_impersonated_user()` - Get the user being viewed
  - `can_impersonate(admin_user, target_user)` - Security validation
  - `start_impersonation(target_user_id)` - Begin impersonation session
  - `stop_impersonation()` - End impersonation session
- **Session management**: Stores `_original_user_id`, `_impersonating_user_id`, `_impersonation_start_time`
- **Security checks**: Validates admin role, 2FA enabled, prevents admin-to-admin impersonation

##### `/bcource/user/user_views.py`
- **Added routes**:
  - `/account/impersonate/<user_id>` (GET, POST)
    - GET: Shows confirmation page with user details
    - POST: Starts impersonation session
  - `/account/stop-impersonate` (GET, POST) - Ends impersonation
- **Security**: All routes require authentication and admin role validation

##### `/bcource/admin/admin_views.py`
- **Added Flask-Admin action**: "Impersonate User" in UserAdmin list view
- **Enhanced UserAdmin**:
  - `column_searchable_list`: Search by email, first name, last name, phone number
  - `column_filters`: Filter by active status and roles
- **Action workflow**: Select user → "With selected" dropdown → Impersonate User → Submit

##### `/bcource/__init__.py`
- **Exposed to templates**: Added `is_impersonating()`, `get_original_user()`, `get_impersonated_user()` to Jinja globals

##### `/bcource/templates/impersonation_banner.html` (New File)
- **Visual warning banner** with:
  - Fixed positioning at top of page (z-index: 9999)
  - Red background (#ff6b6b) for high visibility
  - Responsive Bootstrap design
  - User information display
  - Exit button with CSRF protection
  - Dynamic CSS to push navbar and content down when visible

- **Confirmation page** showing:
  - User details (name, email, ID, roles, status)
  - Warning about action being logged
  - Explanation of what will happen
  - Confirm/Cancel buttons
  - Responsive design

#### Technical Details

##### Security Features
1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Only `db-admin` role (configurable via `BCOURSE_SUPER_USER_ROLE`)
2. **2FA Enforcement**: Administrators must have `tf_primary_method` set
3. **Admin Protection**: `can_impersonate()` prevents admin-to-admin impersonation
4. **Session Isolation**: Original admin session preserved in `_original_user_id`
5. **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
6. **Audit Logging**: WARNING level logs for production visibility

##### Session Management Flow
1. **Start Impersonation**:
   - Save original admin user ID to variables
   - Login as target user with `flask_security_login_user()`
   - Store impersonation flags in session after login
   - Set `session.modified = True` to force persistence
   - Send identity change notification to Flask-Principal
   - Log start event

2. **During Impersonation**:
   - Session contains `_original_user_id` and `_impersonating_user_id`
   - Banner checks `is_impersonating()` on every page load
   - All actions performed as impersonated user

3. **Stop Impersonation**:
   - Retrieve original admin user
   - Login back as admin with `flask_security_login_user()`
   - Clear impersonation session keys
   - Send identity change notification
   - Log stop event with duration

##### Banner Positioning Fix
- **Fixed position**: Banner at `top: 0` with `z-index: 9999`
- **Navbar adjustment**: Pushes navbar down by 80px when impersonating
- **Body padding**: Adds 136px top padding (80px banner + 56px navbar)
- **Dynamic CSS**: Only applies when `is_impersonating()` returns true

##### Database Changes
**None required** - Feature uses session storage only

#### Configuration

Uses existing configuration:
```python
# .env or config.py
BCOURSE_SUPER_USER_ROLE=db-admin  # Role required to impersonate
```

#### User Experience

**Admin Workflow**:
1. Navigate to Admin → Database Admin → User
2. Search for user by name, email, or phone
3. Select user checkbox
4. Choose "Impersonate User" from "With selected" dropdown
5. Review confirmation page
6. Click "Confirm & Start Impersonation"
7. Red banner appears - now viewing as that user
8. Click "Exit Impersonation" when done

**Visual Indicators**:
- Red banner always visible at top
- Shows both impersonated user and original admin
- One-click exit button always accessible

#### API / Helper Functions

**Template Functions** (Jinja):
```jinja
{% if is_impersonating() %}
  Currently impersonating: {{ get_impersonated_user().fullname }}
  Original admin: {{ get_original_user().fullname }}
{% endif %}
```

**Python Functions**:
```python
from bcource.helpers import (
    is_impersonating,
    get_original_user,
    get_impersonated_user,
    can_impersonate,
    start_impersonation,
    stop_impersonation
)
```
